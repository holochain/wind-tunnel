# TODO

## Ways to display data

* are `within_?std` values useful, or can we just show `std`?
* What max precision should we show?

## Metrics that I don't know how to interpret

* `dht_sync_lag`
    * `sync_lag_rate` -- what is the unit?
    * `cascade_duration` -- amount of time spent doing cacade queries?
    * `wasm_usage_total` and sisters -- CPU cycles? RAM?
    * `authored_db_utilization` and sisters -- what do these numbers mean?
